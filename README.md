## &#9889; Getting Started

You can run this project in **two ways**:

### 1 Run with **Docker** (no Node.js required)
This option is perfect if you donâ€™t want to install Node.js locally.

#### Requirements
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Setup
Clone the repo and `cd` into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-repository-search.git
cd github-repository-search
```
Install dependencies inside Docker:
```bash
docker compose run --rm node npm install
```
Start the dev server (exposes `localhost:3000`):
```bash
docker compose run --rm --service-ports node npm run dev
```
Run tests:
```bash
docker compose run --rm node npm test
```
Build production bundle:
```
docker compose run --rm node npm run build
```
